**Title**:  *Wonderful Embedding for group schemes in Bruhat--Tits theory*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>:  <em>For a reductive group G over a discretely valued Henselian field k, using valuations of root datum and concave functions, the Bruhat--Tits theory defines an important class of open bounded subgroups of G(k) which are essential objects in representation theory and arithmetic geometry. Moreover, these subgroups are uniquely determined by smooth affine group schemes whose generic fibers are G over the ring of integers of k. To study these group schemes, in this talk, when G is adjoint and quasi-split, we systematically construct wonderful embedding for these group schemes which are uniquely determined by a big cell structure. The way that we construct our wonderful embedding is different from classical methods in the sense that we avoid embedding a group scheme into an ambient space and taking closure. We use an intrinsic and functorial method which is a variant of Artin--Weil method of birational group laws. Beyond the quasi-split case, our wonderful embedding is constructed by étale descent. Moreover our wonderful embedding behaves in a similar way to the classical wonderful compactification of G. Our results can serve as a bridge between the theory of wonderful compactifications and the Bruhat--Tits theory.</em>

**Title**:  *Explicit computation of Fourier coefficients of Siegel Eisenstein series of degree two*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>:  <em>In this talk, for Siegel modular forms of degree two weight two, we construct a basis of its subspace of Siegel Eisenstein series of square-free level N, and compute their Fourier coefficients explicitly. In addition, we connect the theta series from Yoshida lifting associated to Eichler orders with Siegel Eisenstein series.</em>

**Title**:  *Combinatorial wall-crossing and the Mullineux involution*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>:  <em>The rational Cherednik algebra H_c is an algebra of interest in modern representation theory, which is a degeneration of the double affine Hecke algebra, introduced by Cherednik to prove Macdonald's conjectures about properties of Macdonald polynomials. For values of c lying in chambers separated by walls, representations of H_c are labeled by partitions. Combinatorial wall-crossing is a bijection from the set of irreducible representations of H_c to the set of irreducible representations of H_c', where c and c' lie in adjacent chambers separated by a wall. Combinatorial wall-crossing across one wall was proven by Losev to be equal in large positive characteristic to an extension of the Mullineux involution from modular representation theory of the symmetric group. We will exhibit interesting patterns in combinatorial wall-crossing, both proven and observed in computer experiments, and use them to prove and refine parts of a conjecture of Bezrukavnikov.</em>

**Title**:  *Modularity of Galois representations valued in dual group of SO(n) and applications*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>:  <em>One of the basic ingredients in Wiles’ proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem is modularity lifting theorems of Galois representations valued in GL(2). This was further generalised by Clozel-Harris-Taylor to definite unitary groups. In this talk, I will discuss the case of definite special orthogonal groups and then talk about some potential applications in p-adic Langlands program.</em>

**Title**:  *The relative Auslander-Reiten theory over an infinite-dimensional coalgebra*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>:  <em>In this talk, we will cover several aspects: Firstly, we will delve into the higher-dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory over an infinite-dimensional coalgebra; the finite-dimensional case by duality reduces to that of finite-dimensional algebra. We will introduce the n-transpose of a finitely n-copresented comodule and n-Auslander-Reiten translations, and then prove the n-Auslander-Reiten formula on n-cluster-tilting subcategories of comodule categories. Secondly, we will introduce the Gorenstein transpose via a minimal Gorenstein injective copresentation of a quasi-finite comodule, and explore the relations between the Gorenstein transpose of comodules and the transpose of the same comodule. As an application, we will construct the almost split sequences in terms of Gorenstein transpose. Finally, we will generalize the notion of the Auslander transpose of comodules to that of the transpose with respect to a semidualizing bicomodule T and showcase some nice homological properties of T-transpose. Additionally, we will provide a Foxby equivalence of comodule categories and investigate a characterization of T-reflexive comodules. This work is joint with Prof. Hailou Yao.</em>

**Title**:  *Fundamental groups of curves and local moduli*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>:  <em>In 1996, A. Tamagawa discovered a surprising phenomenon: anabelian geometry also exists for curves over algebraically closed fields of characteristic p>0 (i.e., curves in positive characteristic can possibly be determined by their geometric fundamental groups without relying on Galois actions). However, after 28 years, only a few results have emerged in this field. </em><br>

<em>In this talk, I want to explain the following insight of the speaker about fundamental groups of curves in positive characteristic: </em><br>

<em>The (admissible or geometric log etale) fundamental groups of pointed stable curves over algebraically closed fields of characteristic p can be regarded as an analogue of local moduli spaces of the curves.</em><br>

<em>This observation led to the speaker discovering some new kinds of anabelian phenomena of curves in characteristic p and to formulated numerious new conjectures. For example, the following highly non-trivial anbelian results of the speaker provide strong evidence supporting this insight:</em><br>
  
<em>• The homeomorphism conjecture holds for 1-dimensional moduli spaces (roughly speaking, this conjecture means that the moduli spaces of curves can be reconstructed group-theoretically as topological spaces).</em><br>

<em>• A new proof of Mochizuki’s famous result concerning (Isom-version) Grothendieck’s anabelian conjecture for curves over sub-p-adic fields without using Faltings’ p-adic Hodge theory.</em><br>

<em>• The group-theoretical specialization conjecture holds (roughly speaking, this conjecture means that the topological and group-theoretical degeneration of curves can be completely determined by open continuous homomorphisms of dmissible fundamental groups).</em>

**Title**: *Bruhat--Tits buildings and p-adic period domains*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>: <em>Rémy-Thuillier-Werner constructed embeddings of Bruhat-Tits buildings into the Berkovich spaces associated to suitable flag varieties (generalizing the work of Berkovich for split groups), and defined compactifications of BT buildings by taking closure inside these Berkovich flag varieties. We show that, in the setting of a local Shimura datum, the RTW embedding factors through the associated p-adic period domain (defined by the Fargues-Fontaine curve). This brings the question to compare these two p-adic candidates of symmetric spaces: topological and combinatorial vs p-adic analytic. We will compare the boundaries of the BT buildings and non basic Newton strata. Moreover, we will discuss some applications to cohomology and smooth representations. This is joint work in progress with Ruishen Zhao.</em>
