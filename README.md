**Title**:  *Fundamental groups of curves and local moduli*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>:  <em>In 1996, A. Tamagawa discovered a surprising phenomenon: anabelian geometry also exists for curves over algebraically closed fields of characteristic p>0 (i.e., curves in positive characteristic can possibly be determined by their geometric fundamental groups without relying on Galois actions). However, after 28 years, only a few results have emerged in this field. In this talk, I want to explain the following insight of the speaker about fundamental groups of curves in positive characteristic: The (admissible or geometric log etale) fundamental groups of pointed stable curves over algebraically closed fields of characteristic p can be regarded as an analogue of local moduli spaces of the curves. This observation led to the speaker discovering some new kinds of anabelian phenomena of curves in characteristic p and to formulated numerious new conjectures. For example, the following highly non-trivial anbelian results of the speaker provide strong evidence supporting this insight:</em><br>
  
<em>• The homeomorphism conjecture holds for 1-dimensional moduli spaces (roughly speaking, this conjecture means that the moduli spaces of curves can be reconstructed group-theoretically as topological spaces).</em><br>

<em>• A new proof of Mochizuki’s famous result concerning (Isom-version) Grothendieck’s anabelian conjecture for curves over sub-p-adic fields without using Faltings’ p-adic Hodge theory.</em><br>

<em>• The group-theoretical specialization conjecture holds (roughly speaking, this conjecture means that the topological and group-theoretical degeneration of curves can be completely determined by open continuous homomorphisms of dmissible fundamental groups).</em>

**Title**: *Functions in one p-adic variable*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>: <em>We extend the dictionary between Fontaine’s rings and p-adic functional analysis. As an application, we give a refinement of the p-adic local Langlands correspondence for principal series representations of GL_2(Q_p). This is joint work with Pierre Colmez.</em>

**Title**: *Characteristic classes and conductors in motivic homotopy*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>: <em>We define and study several characteristic classes in motivic homotopy theory, and use them to deduce some conductor formulas. This is a joint work with P. Sun and E. Yang.</em>

**Title**: *Invariant Brauer subgroup for non-linear algebraic group*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>: <em>For algebraic varieties with an action of an algebraic group, the invariant Brauer subgroup is a natural object to study the local-global principle of rational points. In this talk, I will focus on the case if the algebraic group is not necessary linear, and talk about the application of invariant Brauer subgroup to cohomological obstruction and descent method.</em>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>: <em>设K=Q(μ_p,N^(1/p)), p,N是两个素数, 令G=Gal(K/Q). 我将讨论K的理想类群的p-部分, 尤其是其G-模结构与某些模形式L函数特殊值的关系. 这可视为Hebrand-Ribet定理(报告将回顾此定理内容)从分圆域到Kummer型扩张的类比. 在p=3的情形, 可得到些明确的结果.</em>

**Title**: *Plectic weight filtration on cohomology of Hilbert modular varieties*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>: <em>The plectic program is proposed by Jan Nekovar and Tony Scholl to uncover some hidden symmetries of Hilbert modular varieties. It would yield exciting new results on special values of L functions once established. In this talk, I will report my work on the construction of plectic weight filtration, providing evidence of the plectic conjectures.</em>

**Title**: *Bruhat--Tits buildings and p-adic period domains*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>: <em>Rémy-Thuillier-Werner constructed embeddings of Bruhat-Tits buildings into the Berkovich spaces associated to suitable flag varieties (generalizing the work of Berkovich for split groups), and defined compactifications of BT buildings by taking closure inside these Berkovich flag varieties. We show that, in the setting of a local Shimura datum, the RTW embedding factors through the associated p-adic period domain (defined by the Fargues-Fontaine curve). This brings the question to compare these two p-adic candidates of symmetric spaces: topological and combinatorial vs p-adic analytic. We will compare the boundaries of the BT buildings and non basic Newton strata. Moreover, we will discuss some applications to cohomology and smooth representations. This is joint work in progress with Ruishen Zhao.</em>

**Title**:  *A stacky approach to identifying the stability condition*

<p style="text-align: justify;">
<strong>Abstract</strong>:  <em>For any reductive group we find a stacky interpretation of the stability condition for principal bundles over a curve: it is the unique maximal open locus that admits a schematic moduli space. Some applications and further progress will be discussed. This is a joint work with Dario Weissmann and Andres Fernandez Herrero.</em>
