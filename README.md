## Seminar on Arithmetic Geometry and Algebraic Groups

This seminar is focusing on various research topics in arithmetic geometry with special regard to algebraic groups, homogeneous spaces and related structures 
or problems.

Normally, one or two online talks are expected to be scheduled per month. The date and time of each talk will be flexibly arranged according to the speaker's 
convenience. 

The online talks are usually run via the software **Voov Meeting** (or equivalently, **Tencent meeting** in China mainland). 
Please read the [instructions](https://seminaragag.github.io/VoovInstructions.pdf) on downloading and using Voov here.

If you want to receive annoucements of the seminar talks, please email one of the organizers.

**Title**:  *Local-global principles for integral points on certain Markoff-type surfaces*

**Abstract**:  *Ghosh and Sarnak; Loughran and Mitankin; and Colliot-Thélène, Wei, and Xu have recently studied integral points on Markoff surfaces, which 
are affine cubic surfaces defined by a Diophantine equation. In this talk, inspired by these works and a recent paper of Fuchs, Litman, Silverman, and Tran, I
will present some recent results on the Brauer–Manin obstruction to local-global principles for integral points on affine Markoff-type cubic and K3 surfaces 
along with some counting results in this context.*
